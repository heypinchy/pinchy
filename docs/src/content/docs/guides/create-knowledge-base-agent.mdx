title: Create a Knowledge Base Agent
description: Step-by-step guide to creating an agent that can answer questions from your documents.
---

This guide walks you through creating a Knowledge Base agent — an agent that can read and answer questions from your documents, but cannot access anything else on the system.

## Prerequisites

- Pinchy is running (see [Quick Start](/getting-started/))
- You have mounted at least one data directory (see [Mount Data Directories](/guides/mount-data-directories/))
- You are logged in as an admin

## 1. Mount your data directories

Before creating a Knowledge Base agent, make sure the documents you want the agent to access are mounted under `/data/` in the Pinchy container. See the [Mount Data Directories](/guides/mount-data-directories/) guide for detailed instructions.

## 2. Navigate to "New Agent"

In the Pinchy sidebar, click the **+** button next to "Agents" to open the agent creation form.

## 3. Select the "Knowledge Base" template

Choose **Knowledge Base** from the template options. This template pre-configures the agent with safe file access tools (list and read files in approved directories).

## 4. Enter a name and create

Give your agent a descriptive name, for example "HR Policy Assistant" or "Engineering Docs". You can also add an optional tagline like "Answers questions about company HR policies". Then click **Create**.

The agent is created with an auto-generated avatar and you are taken to its chat page. The Knowledge Base template pre-fills operating instructions (AGENTS.md) with document-answering guidelines. The agent has safe file tools enabled by default, but it does not yet know which directories to access. You need to configure that in the Permissions tab.

## 5. Configure directory access

Open the agent's settings by clicking the gear icon, then select the **Permissions** tab.

Under **Safe Tools**, you will see that "List approved directories" and "Read approved files" are already enabled (because the Knowledge Base template includes them). Below the safe tools checkboxes, the **Allowed Directories** picker shows all directories found under `/data/`.

Select the directories that contain the documents this agent should be able to read. For example, if you mounted your HR policies at `/data/hr-policies` and your engineering handbook at `/data/engineering`, select one or both.

Click **Save** to apply the permissions.

## 6. Chat with the agent

Go back to the agent's chat and start asking questions. The agent can:

- List files in the directories you selected
- Read the contents of those files
- Answer questions based on what it reads

The agent **cannot**:

- Access files outside the selected directories
- Execute shell commands
- Make network requests
- Read system files

## Customizing the agent

Beyond permissions, you can customize your Knowledge Base agent through its settings tabs:

- **General** — Change the name, tagline, avatar, or model
- **Personality** — Choose a personality preset (e.g. The Professor for a formal tone) or write custom personality instructions
- **Instructions** — Edit the operating instructions that tell the agent how to handle questions and cite documents
- **Context** — Add organization-specific context like team structure or terminology

## Changing permissions later

You can update an agent's permissions at any time by returning to the **Permissions** tab. Add or remove directories, or enable additional tools as needed. Changes take effect after clicking **Save**.

## How it works

Under the hood, Pinchy uses an allow-list approach. The agent starts with no capabilities and only gets the tools an admin explicitly enables. For a full explanation, see [Agent Permissions](/concepts/agent-permissions/).
