title: Hardening Guide
description: Security best practices for deploying Pinchy in production environments.
---

This guide covers security hardening measures for production Pinchy deployments. Pinchy is self-hosted — infrastructure security is your responsibility. These recommendations assume a Linux server with Docker, but most apply to any OS.

## Reverse proxy with TLS

Never expose the Pinchy Web service directly. Use a reverse proxy with TLS termination.

### Caddy (recommended — automatic HTTPS)

```
pinchy.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:7777
}
```

Caddy automatically provisions and renews Let's Encrypt certificates.

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name pinchy.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/pinchy.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/pinchy.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # TLS hardening
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7777;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket support (required for agent communication)
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pinchy.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

:::caution
WebSocket support is required. Without the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers, agent communication will fail.
:::

## Firewall rules

Only port 443 (HTTPS) needs to be exposed. Block everything else.

### UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw enable
```

### iptables

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

:::note
PostgreSQL (port 5432) and OpenClaw Gateway should never be exposed to the network. Both bind to localhost by default in Pinchy's Docker Compose configuration.
:::

## Disk encryption

PostgreSQL stores all Pinchy data on disk — user accounts, agent configurations, audit logs, and encrypted API keys. Encrypt the underlying volume.

### Linux (LUKS)

```bash
# Encrypt the partition (destructive — do this before deploying)
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
cryptsetup open /dev/sdX pinchy-data
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/pinchy-data
mount /dev/mapper/pinchy-data /var/lib/docker/volumes
```

### macOS (FileVault)

Enable FileVault in System Settings → Privacy & Security. This encrypts the entire startup disk, including Docker volumes.

:::tip
Even with disk encryption, AES-256-GCM encryption is applied to sensitive fields like LLM provider API keys in the database. Disk encryption is a defense-in-depth measure.
:::

## Docker security

### Run as non-root

The Pinchy Docker image runs as a non-root user by default. Verify this is not overridden in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  pinchy:
    # Do NOT add: user: root
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

### Read-only filesystem

Mount the container filesystem as read-only and whitelist only the directories that need writes:

```yaml
services:
  pinchy:
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    volumes:
      - pinchy-data:/data
```

### Resource limits

Prevent a single container from consuming all host resources:

```yaml
services:
  pinchy:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "2.0"
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          memory: 512M
  db:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "1.0"
          memory: 1G
```

## Environment variable protection

The `.env` file contains secrets like `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, and `AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET`. Protect it.

### File permissions

```bash
chmod 600 .env
chown root:root .env
```

### Docker Secrets (Swarm mode)

If you use Docker Swarm, use secrets instead of environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  pinchy:
    secrets:
      - db_password
      - auth_secret
      - audit_hmac_secret

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
  auth_secret:
    file: ./secrets/auth_secret.txt
  audit_hmac_secret:
    file: ./secrets/audit_hmac_secret.txt
```

:::caution
Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control. The `.gitignore` in the Pinchy repository already excludes `.env`, but verify this in your deployment setup.
:::

## Network isolation

Pinchy's Docker Compose setup uses an internal network. PostgreSQL and OpenClaw are not exposed to the host network.

### Verify network isolation

```bash
# Check that only Pinchy Web publishes ports
docker compose ps --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

Only the `pinchy` service should show a published port (7777 by default). The `db` and `openclaw` services should show no published ports, or only `127.0.0.1:PORT` bindings.

### Custom Docker network

For additional isolation, define an explicit internal network:

```yaml
networks:
  pinchy-internal:
    internal: true
  pinchy-external:

services:
  pinchy:
    networks:
      - pinchy-internal
      - pinchy-external
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:7777:7777"
  db:
    networks:
      - pinchy-internal
  openclaw:
    networks:
      - pinchy-internal
```

The `internal: true` flag prevents containers on that network from reaching the internet. The `pinchy` service bridges both networks — it can reach the database and OpenClaw internally, while also serving HTTP traffic.

:::note
Binding to `127.0.0.1:7777` ensures the Pinchy Web service is only reachable from localhost. The reverse proxy running on the same host forwards traffic from port 443.
:::

## AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET configuration

The audit trail uses HMAC-SHA256 to sign every log entry. By default, Pinchy auto-generates a secret at startup. For production, set a persistent secret.

### Generate a secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Set it in your environment

```bash
# .env
AUDIT_HMAC_SECRET=your-generated-hex-string
```

:::caution
If the HMAC secret changes, previously signed audit entries will fail integrity verification. Back up your HMAC secret securely and never rotate it unless you understand the consequences. See [Audit Trail](/concepts/audit-trail/) for details on integrity verification.
:::

## Backup & recovery

### PostgreSQL backups

Create regular backups with `pg_dump`:

```bash
# Backup
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U pinchy pinchy | gzip > "pinchy-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz"

# Restore
gunzip < pinchy-backup-20260222.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T db psql -U pinchy pinchy
```

### Encrypted backups

Encrypt backups before storing them off-site:

```bash
# Backup + encrypt with GPG
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U pinchy pinchy | gzip | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 > "pinchy-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz.gpg"

# Decrypt + restore
gpg --decrypt pinchy-backup-20260222.sql.gz.gpg | gunzip | docker compose exec -T db psql -U pinchy pinchy
```

### Backup schedule

Set up a cron job for daily backups:

```bash
# /etc/cron.d/pinchy-backup
0 3 * * * root cd /opt/pinchy && docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U pinchy pinchy | gzip | gpg --symmetric --batch --passphrase-file /root/.pinchy-backup-passphrase --cipher-algo AES256 > /backups/pinchy-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql.gz.gpg
```

:::tip
Test your restore process regularly. A backup that cannot be restored is not a backup.
:::

## Update strategy

### Docker image updates

Check for new Pinchy releases and update:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Always read the release notes before updating. Back up the database first.

### Dependency scanning

Use tools like Trivy to scan your running images for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
trivy image ghcr.io/heypinchy/pinchy:latest
```

Consider integrating this into a CI pipeline or running it on a schedule. See the [SBOM reference](/reference/sbom/) for information about Pinchy's software bill of materials.

## Monitoring & alerting

### Health endpoint

Monitor the Pinchy Web service by polling its health endpoint:

```bash
curl -f https://pinchy.example.com/api/health || echo "Pinchy is down"
```

### Docker health checks

Add health checks to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  pinchy:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:7777/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s
  db:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U pinchy"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
```

### Log monitoring

Monitor Docker logs for errors and suspicious activity:

```bash
# Follow all service logs
docker compose logs -f

# Filter for errors
docker compose logs pinchy 2>&1 | grep -i error
```

For production, forward logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch) and set up alerts for:

- Authentication failures (`auth.failed` audit events)
- Denied tool executions (`tool.denied` audit events)
- Container restarts
- High error rates

### Audit log monitoring

Use the audit trail API to monitor for security-relevant events programmatically:

```bash
# Check for failed logins in the last 24 hours
curl -b session_cookie "https://pinchy.example.com/api/audit?eventType=auth.failed&from=$(date -d '24 hours ago' -Iseconds)"
```

See [Audit Trail](/concepts/audit-trail/) for the full API reference.
