## What is an SBOM?

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable list of every software component included in a product. It lists packages, versions, and licenses — similar to an ingredient list on food packaging.

SBOMs are increasingly required for enterprise software procurement and are mandated by frameworks like the US Executive Order 14028 and the EU Cyber Resilience Act.

## How Pinchy generates its SBOM

Pinchy generates an SBOM automatically in CI using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) via the `anchore/sbom-action` GitHub Action. The SBOM is generated from the production Docker image (`Dockerfile.pinchy`) and published in **SPDX JSON** format.

The pipeline runs on every push to `main` that changes `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `Dockerfile.pinchy`.

## What the SBOM covers

The SBOM covers the **Pinchy Web Docker image**, which includes:

- **Node.js runtime** and system packages from the base image
- **npm packages** — Next.js, React, Drizzle ORM, Auth.js, and all transitive dependencies
- **OS-level packages** from the Alpine/Debian base layer

### Components not included

The following components run as separate containers and are not covered by Pinchy's SBOM:

| Component | Security information |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | See [postgresql.org/support/security](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/) |
| **OpenClaw Gateway** | See [OpenClaw docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai) |

## Downloading the SBOM

The SBOM is available as a CI artifact from the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Go to the [Pinchy GitHub repository](https://github.com/heypinchy/pinchy)
2. Navigate to **Actions** → **SBOM Generation**
3. Select the latest successful run
4. Download the `sbom` artifact containing `sbom.spdx.json`

## Using the SBOM

### Vulnerability scanning

Feed the SBOM into vulnerability scanners like [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype):

```bash
grype sbom:sbom.spdx.json
```

### License compliance

Extract license information from the SBOM to verify compliance with your organization's policies:

```bash
# List all unique licenses
cat sbom.spdx.json | jq -r '.packages[].licenseConcluded' | sort -u
```

### Supply chain verification

Use the SBOM to verify that no unexpected packages were introduced between releases by diffing two SBOM files.
