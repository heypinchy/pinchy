This guide walks you through getting Pinchy up and running — from cloning the repo to chatting with your first AI agent.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2+)
- An API key from an LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heypinchy/pinchy.git
cd pinchy
```

## 2. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts three services:

- **Pinchy** — the web app on port 7777
- **OpenClaw** — the AI agent runtime (internal, not exposed)
- **PostgreSQL** — the database

Wait until you see `Pinchy ready on http://localhost:7777` in the logs.

## 3. Create your admin account

Open [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) in your browser. The setup wizard appears automatically on first run.

Enter your name, email, and password. This creates the first admin user.

## 4. Configure your AI provider

After creating your account, Pinchy redirects you to the provider setup page. Choose your LLM provider and enter your API key:

| Provider  | Where to get a key                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anthropic | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)     |
| OpenAI    | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Google    | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)   |

Your API key is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database.

## 5. Chat with Smithers

Once your provider is configured, Pinchy redirects you to the chat interface. Your default agent — **Smithers** — greets you automatically.

Type a message and hit Enter. Smithers responds in real time via WebSocket.

## 6. Invite your team

Go to **Settings → Users** to invite team members. Enter their email address and Pinchy generates a one-time invite link.

Each invited user gets their own personal **Smithers** agent, created automatically when they claim the invite. Invite links are valid for 7 days.

## 7. Create a Knowledge Base Agent (optional)

You can create agents from templates. Creating an agent is simple: pick a template, give it a name, add an optional tagline, and click Create. Each agent gets a unique auto-generated avatar.

For example, a **Knowledge Base** agent can read files in directories you select — but has no access to anything else by default. After creating the agent, you can customize it through the agent settings tabs:

- **General** — Change the agent's name, tagline, avatar, and model
- **Personality** — Choose a personality preset or write custom personality instructions (SOUL.md)
- **Instructions** — Define what the agent should do and how it should handle tasks (AGENTS.md)
- **Context** — Add organization-specific context like company info or team conventions (USER.md)
- **Permissions** — Configure which tools and directories the agent can access

To try it out, mount a directory with documents into the Pinchy container and create an agent from the Knowledge Base template. See the [Create a Knowledge Base Agent](/guides/create-knowledge-base-agent/) guide for the full walkthrough.
