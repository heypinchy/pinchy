/**
 * Validates that config/openclaw.json (the file baked into the Docker image
 * and copied to the openclaw-config named volume on first container start)
 * contains all fields that Pinchy writes on its first config.apply call.
 *
 * Why this matters:
 *   OC captures `currentCompareConfig` (= `startupLastGoodSnapshot.sourceConfig`)
 *   during startup. The reload handler diffs incoming config.apply payloads
 *   against `currentCompareConfig` to decide whether a gateway restart is needed.
 *   If the baked-in config is missing any field that Pinchy adds on first apply,
 *   the reload handler detects a diff and triggers a restart. During that in-
 *   process restart, OC's `ensureGatewayStartupAuth` uses the stale
 *   `initialSnapshotRead` (captured before the auth token was written), sees an
 *   empty token, and tries to write it — but Pinchy's concurrent write already
 *   changed the hash, causing ConfigMutationConflictError.
 *
 *   Reload rules (BASE_RELOAD_RULES_TAIL in OC source):
 *     gateway   → restart
 *     discovery → restart
 *     canvasHost → restart
 *     update    → restart (no rule → default)
 *
 *   All four sections must be present in the baked-in config with Pinchy's
 *   expected stable values so the first config.apply is a no-op diff for these
 *   paths. See openclaw#75534 and CI failures in PR #279.
